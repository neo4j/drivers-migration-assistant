✔ 5.0a1 Result, Session, and Transaction can no longer be imported from neo4j.work. Import them from neo4j instead.

✔ 4.4.6, 5.0a2 Deprecate timeout config options introduced in 4.4.5 (#768).
update_routing_table_timeout and session_connection_timeout have been deprecated and will be removed in 5.0.
Server-side keep-alives communicated through configuration hints together with connection_acquisition_timeout are sufficient to avoid the driver getting stuck.

~ 5.0a2 ⚠️ Deprecated Nodes' and Relationships' id property (int) in favor of element_id (str).
This also affects Graph objects as indexing graph.nodes[...] and graph.relationships[...] with integers has been deprecated in favor of indexing them with strings.

✔⚠️ The trust option has been deprecated.
Use trusted_certificates instead.
New options trusted_certificates and ssl_context have been added

✔⚠️ Session.last_bookmark was deprecated. Its behaviour is partially incorrect and cannot be fixed without breaking its signature.
Use Session.last_bookmarks instead.
✔ neo4j.Bookmark was deprecated.
Use neo4j.Bookmarks instead.

Removed deprecated parts in the neo4j.time module (#635).
Duration
✔ The constructor does not accept subseconds anymore.
Use milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds instead.
✔ The property subseconds has been removed.
Use nanoseconds instead.
✔ The property hours_minutes_seconds has been removed.
Use hours_minutes_seconds_nanoseconds instead.
For all math operations holds: they are element-wise on (months, days, nanoseconds). This affects (i.e., changes) the working of //, %, /, and *.
Years are equal to 12 months.
Weeks are equal to 7 days.
seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds are implicitly converted to nanoseconds or seconds as fit.
Multiplication and division allow for floats but will always result in integer values (round to nearest even).

Time
✔ The constructor does not accept floats for second anymore. Use nanosecond instead.
Ticks are now nanoseconds since midnight (int).
The property ticks_ns has been renamed to ticks. The old ticks is no longer supported.
The property from_ticks_ns has been renamed to from_ticks. The old from_ticks is no longer supported.
✔ The property second returns an int instead of a float. Use nanosecond to get the sub-second information.
✔ The property hour_minute_second has been removed. Use hour_minute_second_nanosecond instead.

DateTime
✔ The property hour_minute_second has been removed. Use hour_minute_second_nanosecond instead.
The property second returns an int instead of a float. Use nanosecond to get the sub-second information.

✔ The first argument of transaction functions is now a ManagedTransaction object. It behaves exactly like a regular Transaction object, except it does not offer the commit, rollback, close, and closed methods.

✔ Removed deprecated ResultSummary.server.version_info (#636). Use ResultSummary.server.agent, ResultSummary.server.protocol_version, or call the dbms.components procedure instead.

✔ Importing submodules from neo4j.time (neo4j.time.xyz) has been deprecated. Everything needed should be imported from neo4j.time directly.
✔ neo4j.spatial.hydrate_point and neo4j.spatial.dehydrate_point have been deprecated without replacement. They are internal functions.
✔ Importing neo4j.packstream has been deprecated. It's internal and should not be used by client code.
✔ Importing neo4j.routing has been deprecated. It's internal and should not be used by client code.
✔ Importing neo4j.config has been deprecated. It's internal and should not be used by client code.
✔ neoj4.Config, neoj4.PoolConfig, neoj4.SessionConfig, and neoj4.WorkspaceConfig have been deprecated without replacement. They are internal classes.
✔ Importing neo4j.meta has been deprecated. It's internal and should not be used by client code. ExperimantalWarning should be imported directly from neo4j. neo4j.meta.version is exposed through neo4j.__vesrion__
✔ Importing neo4j.data has been deprecated. It's internal and should not be used by client code. Record should be imported directly from neo4j instead.
✔ neo4j.data.DataHydrator and neo4j.data.DataDeydrator have been removed without replacement.

5.3 ⚠️ Deprecated package-alias neo4j-driver. It will stop receiving updates starting with 6.0.0. Please install neo4j instead (#867).

5.3 The experimental BookmarkManager API received a necessary change that simplifies it and makes it work correctly (#859). Added in 5.0, changed in 5.3, stabilized in 5.8.
It will no longer track bookmarks per database. This effectively changes the signature of almost all bookmark manager related methods:
neo4j.BookmarkManger and neo4j.AsyncBookmarkManger abstract base classes:
update_bookmarks has no longer a database argument.
get_bookmarks has no longer a database argument.
The get_all_bookmarks method was removed.
The forget method was removed.
neo4j.GraphDatabase.bookmark_manager and neo4j.AsyncGraphDatabase.bookmark_manager factory methods:
initial_bookmarks is no longer a mapping from database name to bookmarks but plain bookmarks.
bookmarks_supplier no longer receives the database name as an argument.
bookmarks_consumer no longer receives the database name as an argument.

✔ Undocumented helper methods Neo4jError.is_fatal_during_discovery and Neo4jError.invalidates_all_connections have been deprecated and will be removed without replacement in version 6.0

✔ 5.7 ⚠️ Importing neo4j.work and its submodules has been deprecated. Everything should be imported directly from neo4j instead.

✔ 5.22 ⚠️ As part of this work, SummaryNotificationPosition has been deprecated in favor of SummaryInputPosition.
